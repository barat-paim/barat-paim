# 👋 Hey, I’m Barath  
🚀 **Building AI systems that think, plan, and execute**  

I work at the intersection of **AI workflows, automation, and intelligent agents**—bridging the gap between **LLM reasoning and real-world execution.**  

## 🔍 What I’m Into:  
- **AI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems** – Let’s make AI work together, not just in silos.  
- **LLM Execution & API Automation** – AI that doesn’t just predict, but actually **does** things.  
- **AI Infrastructure & Scaling** – From fine-tuning models to deploying inference pipelines.  
- **RL for Task Planning & Decision-Making** – Teaching AI how to think ahead.  

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On:  
- **LLM-powered task automation & API execution**  
- **Scalable AI architectures & inference optimizations**  
- **Experimental RL applications (sports, finance, workflows, etc.)**  

## ⚡ About Me:  
- **Cofounder, DojoLM** → AI orchestration & execution  
- **Ex-AWS AI/ML** → Model monitoring & inference pipelines  
- **Background in AI Research, Data Science & Business (IIM MBA)**
